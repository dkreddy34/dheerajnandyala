### About Me
I’m a passionate **Data Engineer** who loves solving business challenges through data-driven systems. I specialize in **designing scalable ETL pipelines, automating data flows, and transforming raw data into actionable insights**. My goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic insights by integrating modern tools, cloud platforms, and visualization technologies.  

Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Business Analytics & Information Management** at the **University of Delaware**, I’m focused on mastering data engineering workflows that blend **automation, governance, and performance** across diverse ecosystems.
